The aim of the solution developed was to solve the problems given below,

1. Identification of trends from social media.
2. Mapping trends with Flipkart products.

## Outline
The development of the proposed solution was divided into three parts,

1. ### Automated Bots for Scraping Required Images and Metadata
     - These bots were used to perform asynchronous scraping of images and metadata from various platforms such as Instagram, Pinterest, etc.
     
2. ### Trend Identification and Image Classification
     - This tier was concerned with handling the images obtained in the previous stage, and identifying the fashion trends involved in them, and hence classifying the images.
     - This was achieved using deep neural networks (based on VGG16 Architecture) to identify the trends present in the data collected.

3. ### Flipkart Relevant Smart Mapper
     - This was built to return a series of results/recommendations for a search query in a using query construction techniques, with the result being mapped the to the attributes present on the Flipkart website. 
     - This was built using a combination of Fuzzy techniques, Rule based learning and the Wordnets library to map a given phrase to Flipkart relevant format.
